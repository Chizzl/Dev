Preferred Git client : https://git-fork.com/ (Free | Mac & Windows)

### Connecting to a remote (GitHub) repo via SSH

#### Add a remote repo in Fork

Right-click Remotes and choose 'Add new remote'

##### Repository url : https vs SSH

**HTTPS**

With https you need to enter credentials every time you push code your to the remote.  SSH is the preffered way.

**SSH**

Before using SSH, you need to have a SSH key generated on your computer before adding it to Github to connect to your remote repositories.

*Add SSH key on your computer to connect remotely with SSH.*
