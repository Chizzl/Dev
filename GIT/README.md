### Connecting to a remote (GitHub) repo via SSH

Add SSH key on your computer to connect remotely with SSH.  (With https you need to enter credentials every time you push code)

Check for existing SSH or create new : https://help.github.com/articles/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys/ 

If you don't have a SSH key yet, create new SSH key : https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/
